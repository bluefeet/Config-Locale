=head1 NAME

Config::Locale - Load and merge locale-specific configuration files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Config::Locale;
    
    my $locale = Config::Locale->new(
        identity => \@values,
        directory => $config_dir,
    );
    
    my $config = $locale->config();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module takes an identity array, determines the permutations of the identity using
L<Algorithm::Loops>, loads configuration files using L<Config::Any>, and finally combines
the configurations using L<Hash::Merge>.

So, given this setup:

    Config::Locale->new(
        identity => ['db', '1', 'qa'],
    );

The following configuration files will be looked for (listed from least specific to most):

    default
    all.all.qa
    all.1.all
    all.1.qa
    db.all.all
    db.all.qa
    db.1.all
    db.1.qa

For each file found the contents will be parsed and then merged together to produce the
final configuration hash.  The hashes will be merged so that the most specific configuration
file will take precedence over the least specific files.  So, in the example above,
"db.1.qa" values will overwrite values from "default".

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=head2 identity

The identity that configuration files will be loaded for.  In a typical hostname-basedc
configuration setup this will be the be the parts of the hostname that declare the class,
number, and cluster that the current host identifies itself as.  But, this could be any
list of values.

=head2 directory

The directory to load configuration files from.  Defaults to the current
directory.

=head2 wildcard

The wildcard string to use when constructing the configuration filenames.
Defaults to "all".  This may be explicitly set to undef wich will cause
the wildcard string to not be added to the filenames at all.

=head2 default

The name of the configuration file that contains the default configuration.
Defaults to "default".  This may be explcitly set to undef which will cause
the default configuration file to look just like all the other configuration
files, just using the L</wildcard> for all of the identity values.

=head2 separator

The character that will be used to separate the identity keys in the
configuration filenames.  Defaults to ".".

=head2 prefix

An optional prefix that will be prepended to the configuration filenames.

=head2 suffix

An optional suffix that will be apended to the configuration filenames.
While it may seem like the right place, you probably should not be using
this to specify the extension of your configuration files.  L<Config::Any>
automatically tries many various forms of extensions without the need
to explicitly declare the extension that you are using.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 config

Contains the final configuration hash as merged from the hashes in L</configs>.

=head2 configs

Contains an array of hashrefs, one hashref for each file in L</stems> that
exists.

=head2 stems

Contains an array of L<Path::Class::File> objects for each value in L</combinations>.

=head2 combinations

Holds an array of arrays containing all possible premutations of the
identity.
